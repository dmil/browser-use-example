1. **Scrape the Index Page: Articles and Pagination**
   - **Article Selector:** Each article title is an `<a>` element directly under the publication date. CSS selector can be `div.views-row > div.views-field-title > span.field-content > a`.
   - **Pagination Selector:** Pagination uses `<a>` elements with titles like 'Go to page 2'. CSS selector can be `.pager a`.

2. **Scrape an Individual Article: Title, Date, Text**
   - **Title Selector:** The article title can be selected with a CSS selector specific to a headline tag (e.g., `h1.article-title` or similar based on actual HTML structure once inspected).
   - **Date Selector:** Date is often in a separate `<span>` or `<p>` tagged with date classes. A specific selector will depend on the detailed HTML structure (likely an adjacent sibling to the title).
   - **Text Selector:** Article text is typically inside `<p>` tags within a container (e.g., `div.article-body p`). Precise selectors depend on inspecting the actual HTML structure beside these common patterns.
